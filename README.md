# StayHydrated
Incredibly simple yet essential app with a simple goal: GET YOU TO DRINK THE MOST VALUABLE LIQUID IN THE UNIVERSE.

## Why I created this
Did you know that 75% of americans are constantly dehydrated? That's scary. Dehydration causes fatigue, dizziness and it lowers your mental and physical performance. That performance is especially important for people like me, who love programming and gaming. It can make you much worse at performing in games and can also make or break a session. **I definitely have chronic dehydration and I want to help people who are cursed by it too!**

## Installation
There are two methods of obtaining this piece of software:
1. You can manually compile. I will be assuming you know what to do and I won't be covering this entire process here, but essentially, first off you git clone this repo and then ***YOU MUST COMPILE*** with `go build -ldflags -H="windowsgui" main.go config.go autostart.go systray.go`
2. The most simple way is to go to https://github.com/Finnbyte/StayHydrated/releases and download StayHydrated.exe from there.
